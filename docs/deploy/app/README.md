# Configuring the Leaf App Server
The application server hosts the [Leaf REST API](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/src/server), and serves as the intermediary between the [client app](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/src/ui-client) and [databases](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/src/db).

The API is written in C# and .NET Core, and can run in either Linux or Windows environments. Unless otherwise noted, examples below assume a CentOS7 server.


## Prerequisites

CentOS requires .NET to be installed prior to building the application. Refer to Microsoft's current instructions for installing .NET Core framework.
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/rhel/sdk-current


Currently installing .NET on CentOS/RHEL looks like this:

```bash
rpm -Uvh https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/7/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm
yum install -y dotnet-sdk-2.2
```


We'll be using the following example folder layout for organizing the api deployment as outlined below:  

- /var/opt/leafapi/leaf_download       
- /var/opt/leafapi/.keys              
- /var/opt/leafapi/api                
- /var/opt/leafapi/services            
- /var/log/leaf           



Provided you've got a github account and have setup your SSH key, downloading the source with git is as simple as:

```
mkdir /var/opt/leafapi/leaf_download
cd /var/opt/leafapi/leaf_download
git clone git@github.com:uwrit/leaf.git
```

Once the source is downloaded you can proceed to build and configure an API instance.


## Installation
1) [Creating a JWT Signing Key](#creating-a-jwt-signing-key)
2) [Setting Environment Variables](#setting-environment-variables)
3) [Configuring the appsettings.json file](#configuring-the-appsettingsjson-file)
4) [Building the API](#building-the-api)
5) [Deploying the API as a Service](#deploying-the-api-as-a-service)


## Creating a JWT Signing Key
The Leaf client and server communicate by [JSON Web Tokens, or JWTs](https://jwt.io/introduction/) (pronounced "JAh-ts"). In a bash terminal, start by creating a JWT signing key. This allows the JWT recipient to verify the sender is who they say they are.

Note that the output paths and password can be whatever you'd like, and you'll need to reference them in the environment variables in the next step.

```bash
openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout <your_key_path>/key.pem \
    -out <your_cert_path>/cert.pem -days 3650 -subj \
    "/CN=urn:leaf:issuer:leaf.<your_institution>.<tld>"
```
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in <your_key_path>/cert.pem -inkey key.pem \
    -export -out <your_key_path>/leaf.pfx -password pass:<your_pass>
```

## Setting Environment Variables

### Windows 
Sensitive configuration data specifying data sources and passwords are stored in environmental variables. Where these environment variables are defined depends on which web server is being used.

#### IIS
In IIS they are defined as configuration items in your backing application in IIS itself.

![IIS Environment Variables Navigation](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/deploy/images/iis_environ.png "IIS Environment Variables Navigation")

![IIS Environment Variable Entries](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/deploy/images/iis_env_vars.png "IIS Environment Variable Entries")

#### Apache
In Apache they are defined as OS level environment variables for the user running the API service.

![OS Environment Variables](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/deploy/images/windows_env_vars.png "OS Environment Variables")

Make sure the following variables are defined:

- LEAF_JWT_CERT=<your_cert_path>/cert.pem
- LEAF_JWT_KEY=<your_key_path>/leaf.pfx
- LEAF_JWT_KEY_PW=<your_pass>
- LEAF_APP_DB=<leaf_app_db_connection_string>
- LEAF_CLIN_DB=<clinical_db_connection_string>
- SERILOG_DIR=<your_logging_path>
- LEAF_REDCAP_SUPERTOKEN=<your_token>


### Linux
Sensitive configuration data specifying data sources and passwords are stored in environmental variables defined in a .conf file. 

```bash
# Contents for api service conf file: /var/opt/leafapi/services/leaf_api.service.conf

LEAF_JWT_CERT=/var/opt/leafapi/.keys/cert.pem
LEAF_JWT_KEY=/var/opt/leafapi/.keys/leaf.pfx
LEAF_JWT_KEY_PW=<insertpass>
LEAF_APP_DB=<leaf_app_db_connection_string>
LEAF_CLIN_DB=<clinical_db_connection_string>
SERILOG_DIR=/var/log/leaf/
ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:5001
LEAF_REDCAP_SUPERTOKEN='<your_token>'
```

It's recommended that you use full paths when referencing locations on the filesystem.

Note:
- LEAF_REDCAP_SUPERTOKEN is not needed if appsettings.json has the REDCap export variable set to 'false'.
- The ASPNETCORE_URLS parameter determines what port and IP the API service listens on, and **is only needed for Linux installations**.
- The connection string variables `LEAF_APP_DB` and `LEAF_CLIN_DB` should be of the form:
```
Server=<server>;Database=<dbname>;uid=sa;Password=<dbpassword>;
```

## Configuring the appsettings.json file
The [appsettings.json file](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/server/API/appsettings.json) acts as the central configuration file for your Leaf instance. 

Key tasks to complete when setting up a Leaf instance for the first time:
- Set Jwt/Issuer to match JAWT issuer parameter set during JAWT creation above
- Define LogoutURI 
- Set Authorization/Mechanism/SAML2/HeaderMapping/Entitlements variables to define the SAML2 header containing group membership, and the delimiter separating group names
- Authorization/Mechanism/SAML2/RoleMapping roles to match group names provided by SAML2 
- Define Client/Help variables
- Ensure Export/REDCap/Enabled is set to false

Pre-build this file can be found under `src/server/API/` relative to the Leaf git repository root directory. After the API is built and deployed, it can be found and further customized at the top level of the API dll directory.

## Runtime
Contains a mode field, indicating `FULL` or `GATEWAY`.
### Mode
- `FULL` enables the cohort functionality in Leaf's API.
- `GATEWAY` disables cohort functionality in Leaf's API.
## JWT
Properties relating to Leaf-issued JavaScript Web tokens (JWTs).
### SigningKey
Environment Variable which points to the path [for the JWT signing key](#creating-a-jwt-signing-key). This should be `LEAF_JWT_KEY`.
### Password
Environment Variable which stores the password for the JWT signing key. This should be `LEAF_JWT_KEY_PW`.
### Certificate
Environment Variable which points to the path of the `cert/pem` file. This should be `LEAF_JWT_CERT`.
### Issuer
The `Issuer` is a global identifier in a Leaf instance that represents the origin of a JWT, and should be unique. The recommended practice for this is `leaf.<your_institution>.edu`, where `<your_institution>.edu` is a unique domain name. This is a suggested practice though, as this simply needs to be a globally unique string 200 characters or less.
## DB
Properties relating to the Leaf application and clinical databases.
### App
Properties relating to the Leaf application database.
#### Connection
Environment Variable which contains the connection string for the Leaf application database. This should be `LEAF_APP_DB`.
#### DefaultTimeout
Default timeout length in seconds for database calls.
### Clin
Properties relating to the clinical database that Leaf is to query.
#### Connection
Environment Variable which contains the connection string for the clinical database. This should be `LEAF_CLIN_DB`.
#### DefaultTimeout
Default timeout length in seconds for clinical queries. Depending on a variety of factors, certain queries may be longer-running and thus this should be relatively high, such as 120 to 180 seconds.
## Authentication
```javascript
"Authentication": {
  "Mechanism": "SAML2",
  "SessionTimeoutMinutes": 480,
  "InactivityTimeoutMinutes": 20,
  "LogoutURI": "<your config specific fully qualified logout URI>",
  "SAML2": {
    "Headers": {
      "ScopedIdentity": "eppn"
    }
  }
}
```
### Mechanism
Either `SAML2` or `UNSECURED`.
- Choose `SAML2` in all non-development environments.
- Choose `UNSECURED` only in development settings.
### SessionTimeoutMinutes
This should be functionally equivalent to the Service Provider's configured `Sessions.lifetime` value. 28800 seconds would translate to 480 minutes.
### InactivityTimeoutMinutes
This should be functionally equivalent to the Service Provider's configured `Sessions.timeout` value. 3600 seconds would translate to 60 minutes.
### LogoutURI
This value is highly dependent on your specific Shibboleth configuration. Please read the [official documentation](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SP3/Logout), additionally [NC State's documentation](https://docs.shib.ncsu.edu/docs/logout.html) provides excellent examples to follow.
### SAML2
Configures the SAML2 authentication integration layer.
#### Headers
Configures how authentication payload should be extracted from the request headers.
#### ScopedIdentity
Configures how the scoped identity header key will look.
## Authorization
```javascript
"Authorization": {
  "Mechanism": "SAML2",
  "SAML2": {
    "HeadersMapping": {
      "Entitlements": {
        "Name": "gws-groups",
        "Delimiter": ";"
      }
    },
    "RolesMapping": {
      "User": "urn:mace:users",
      "Super": "urn:mace:supers",
      "Identified": "urn:mace:phi",
      "Admin": "urn:mace:sudos",
      "Federated": "urn:mace:federated"
    }
  }
}
```
### Mechanism
Either `SAML2`, `ACTIVEDIRECTORY`, or `UNSECURED`.
- Choose `SAML2` if a user's group memberships will arrive from the IdP.
- Choose `ACTIVEDIRECTORY` if Leaf should go source group membership directly from an Active Directory instance.
- `UNSECURED` is only to be used in development settings.`
### SAML2
Configures the SAML2 authorization integration layer.
#### HeadersMapping
Configures how the entitlement payload should be extracted from the request headers.
##### Entitlements
Configures how the entitlement header will look.
###### Name
Configures the header key to look for.
###### Delimeter
Configures the character or string used to delimit the list of groups.
#### RoleMapping
Configures how groups are mapped to Leaf roles. All roles are required to be mapped, even if they map to the same groups. For example, you may wish for all super users to be admins, in that case you may map those roles to the same group.
## Compiler
Properties relating to the Leaf SQL Compiler. If you are using common data models such as OMOP or i2b2, feel free to simply use the below templates:

OMOP v5:
```javascript
"Compiler": {
  "Alias": "@",
  "SetPerson": "dbo.person",
  "SetEncounter": "dbo.visit_occurrence",
  "FieldPersonId": "person_id",
  "FieldEncounterId": "visit_occurrence_id",
  "FieldEncounterAdmitDate": "visit_start_date",
  "FieldEncounterDischargeDate": "visit_end_date"
}
```

i2b2:
```javascript
"Compiler": {
  "Alias": "@",
  "SetPerson": "dbo.PATIENT_DIMENSION",
  "SetEncounter": "dbo.VISIT_DIMENSION",
  "FieldPersonId": "PATIENT_NUM",
  "FieldEncounterId": "ENCOUNTER_NUM",
  "FieldEncounterAdmitDate": "START_DATE",
  "FieldEncounterDischargeDate": "END_DATE"
}
```

### Alias
The global character that acts as a indicator for inserting an alias for a `SQL Set`. Typically the `@` character is used. 

Why is this needed? Consider the `SQL` statement:

```sql
SELECT E.*
FROM dbo.Person AS P
     INNER JOIN dbo.Encounter AS E
        ON P.PersonId = E.PersonId
WHERE PersonId = 123        
```
This would return an error because `PersonId` in the `WHERE` clause could be from either `dbo.Person` or `dbo.Encounter`. To solve this example, we could simply change this to `WHERE P.PersonId = 123`, with `P.` preceding `PersonId`.

Because Leaf writes highly variable `SQL`, it needs a hint of where to insert aliases for a given `SQL Set` to ensure errors like the above do not happen. An example of these using the `@` character could be a date field, `@.observation_date`, or a `WHERE` clause, `@.lab_type = 'WBC'`. Note that in both cases the `@` character acts as a placeholder and would be replaced at runtime with a real alias.
### SetPerson
The primary SQL table or view that has **one row per patient**, typically containing demographic information.
### SetEncounter
The primary SQL table or view that has **one row per encounter**, typically containing information such as the visit type and admit and discharge dates.
### FieldPersonId
The SQL field that must be present on every SQL object Leaf will query and contains unique identifiers for patients in the database.
### FieldEncounterId
The SQL field that must be present on every SQL object Leaf will query which has a one-to-many relationship to patients, such that patients can have many over time. This field represents unique identifiers for encounters.
### FieldEncounterAdmitDate
The SQL field that represents the admission date and time for a given encounter. This field should be present on the table or view defined in [SetEncounter](#setencounter).
### FieldEncounterDischargeDate
The SQL field that represents the discharge date and time for a given encounter. This field should be present on the table or view defined in [SetEncounter](#setencounter).

## Cohort
Properties relating to the Leaf application patient cache.
### SetCohort
The Leaf application database's patient ID cache table. This should be set to `app.Cohort`.
### FieldCohortPersonId
The Leaf application database's patient ID field. This should be set to `PersonId`.
### RowLimit
The maximum number of patients that Leaf will cache upon running a cohort definition query. If a given query returns more unique patients than this value, Leaf will simply return the count and the user will not be able to see visualization information or row-level data.
### ExportLimit
The maximum number of individual patients that Leaf will return to the client on the `Patient List` screen. If the total patients in the cohort exceed this value, only the first number of patients at or under this value will be returned to the client.

## Export
Properties relating to the export of data from Leaf to other applications.
### REDCap
Properties relating to the export of data to a [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) instance. REDCap export is completely optional.
#### Enabled
Boolean value indicated whether or not REDCap export should be enabled. This must be `true` or `false`.
#### ApiURI
The absolute path to a given REDCap instance's root API path, such as `https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/api`. Note that this should **not** end with `/`.
#### BatchSize
The number of rows of data per API request that Leaf will export to REDCap. This number should be relatively low, such as 10, and is used to give feedback to users as to progress and estimated time remaining.
#### RowLimit
The absolute maximium number of rows that Leaf will export to REDCap. Note that the Leaf client can exceed this number if users are simply viewing the `Patient List`, but they will be prevented from exporting. This is designed to prevent the export of larger datasets than REDCap is able to effectively manage. Setting this value to `0` allows an unlimited number of rows to be exported.
#### Scope
The scoped identity for the REDCap instance that will be exported to. This is typically the `u.<insitution>.edu` in `sally_johnson@u.<institution>.edu`. When assigning user permissions via the REDCap API, Leaf will prepend the current user name (e.g. `sally_johnson`) to this value.
#### SuperToken
Environment Variable which stores the REDCap Super Token which is used for project creation. This should be `LEAF_REDCAP_SUPERTOKEN`.

## Client
Configuration properties which are sent to the Leaf client.
### Map
Properties relating to the `Map` screen in the Leaf client.
![Map](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/deploy/images/map_example.png "Map")
#### Enabled
Boolean value indicating whether to show a `Map` tab on the left of the screen. This must be `true` or `false`. If false, no tab will be shown and maps cannot be viewed.
#### TileURI
URI for the `tile layer` from which to request dynamic images and generate maps for, such as `https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`. Leaf uses [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and [React-Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) for map generation. A list of Leaflet tile layer providers can be found here https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/.

### Help
Properties relating to the `Help` floating button which appears in the lower-left of the screen. If enabled, the help button must have values in either the [Email](#email) or [URI](#uri) properties, or both.
![Help](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/docs/deploy/images/help.gif "Help")
#### Enabled 
Boolean value indicating whether to show the `Help` button. This must be `true` or `false`. If false, nothing will be shown.
#### Email
Email address to direct user questions to, such as `<your_support_email>.edu`. Clicking `Contact a Leaf administrator` will direct users' default email client to draft a new email to this address.
#### URI
Similar to [Email](#email), but instead a URL to direct users to if clicked, such as a FAQ page. This will be clickable under `Learn more here`.

## Building the API
There are a variety of ways to build the API, as the `dotnet` CLI tool supports both self-contained builds as well as runtime dependent targets. Although .NET Core is cross-platform, some targets have quirks that should be noted. If you're curious, you can review the [build.sh](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/build.sh) script in the project's root directory. Self-contained builds produce an executable and embed the entire .NET runtime in the build artifacts, resulting in a much larger deployment payload but removing the need to install the .NET Core runtime on your target machine. Conversely, runtime dependent builds assume that the .NET Core runtime will be installed on your target machine and only includes the application and its 3rd party dependencies in the artifact folder.




### Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)/CentOS
RHEL7 and Cent7 only support runtime dependent builds.

On RHEL7 or Cent7 with .NET Core installed:
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o <output_dir>
```

First we change directory into where we downloaded leaf (unzipped) from github. Then targeting our example folder structure, as outline above, our build command would be:

```bash
cd /var/opt/leaf/leaf_download/leaf/
dotnet publish -c Release -o /var/opt/leafapi/api
```


To build on Windows/MacOS building for RHEL/Cent:
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o <output_dir> -r rhel.7-x64 --self-contained false /p:MicrosoftNETPlatformLibrary=Microsoft.NETCore.App
```


### Windows
Windows fully supports both self-contained builds as well as runtime dependent builds.

Self-contained:
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -o <output_dir>
```
Runtime dependent:
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -o <output_dir>
```


## Deploying the API as a Service

Once built the API service should be run with a service account that is not an administrative user.

The API host firewall will need to allow inbound communication on the chosen port to the apache web server.



### Defining a *nix style service with CentOS7/RHEL Linux

First create a nologin user account to isolate the service from the operating system, and give that account ownership over the API -related folders.

```bash
useradd -r api_svc_account
chown /var/log/leaf/
chown -R /var/opt/leaf/
```

Next create a service file for the API instance. The WorkingDirectory must be the directory where API.dll resides.

```bash
## /var/opt/leafapi/services/leaf_api.service

[Unit]
Description=Leaf API Service

[Service]
EnvironmentFile=/var/opt/leafapi/services/leaf_api.service.conf
User=api_svc_account
Type=idle
TimeoutStartSec=300
TimeoutStopSec=30
WorkingDirectory=/var/opt/leafapi/api/
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dotnet API.dll 

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Lastly, link your service file with systemd, and make it aware of the service:

```bash
# Create a symbolic link into the systemd directory
ln -s /var/opt/leafapi/services/leaf_api.service /etc/systemd/system/leaf_api.service

#Make the systemd aware of the service
systemctl daemon-reload
```

To start the service:

```bash
systemctl start leaf_api.service
```


### Defining a Windows Service

Review Microsoft's official instructions for guidance on defining a Windows service with Powershell:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/new-service?view=powershell-6



## Reviewing API Logs
Provided that the permissions are correct for your API Service account user, logs will be located in the folder defined via the SERILOG_DIR variable in the service's leaf_api.service.conf file created earlier.

Logs are also logged to /var/log/messages.
