                            Because you've logged in <span className={`${c}-info-emphasis`}>de-identified mode</span>, Leaf has date-shifted and removed identifiers for all data shown below.
                            This means that all dates have been randomly shifted a certain amount of time, and identifiers such as MRNs and names have been removed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note: While the amount of time shifted is different between patients, the 
                            <span className={`${c}-info-emphasis`}> date-shift value for a given patient is consistent</span>
                            , so the relative age at an event is preserved.
